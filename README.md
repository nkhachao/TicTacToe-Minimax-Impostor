# TicTacToe-Minimax-Impostor

Minimax Impostor is a neural network that plays Tic Tac Toe by mimicking Minimax algorithm. The goal is to create a less CPU intensive alternative to Minimax algorithm, which allows it to be implemented on larger Tic Tac Toe boards.

Each major version of Minimax Impostor will be added as a separate file instead of replacing its predecessor.

--------------- Quick Start Guide ----------------

To play Tic Tac Toe agaisnt Minimax Impostor, run Playground.py. No configuration needed

Where the game is: TicTacToe.py. A library for playing GUI Tic Tac Toe on Python
Where the neural network is: Minimax_Impostor.py
Where the magic lies: DNA_Data.py. This is where weight values of Minimax Impostor neural network are stored.
No training code is available.
