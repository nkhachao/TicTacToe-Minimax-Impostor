# TicTacToe-Minimax-Impostor

Minimax Impostor is a neural network that plays Tic Tac Toe by mimicking Minimax algorithm. The goal is to create a less CPU intensive alternative to Minimax algorithm, which allows it to be implemented on larger Tic Tac Toe boards.

Each major version of Minimax Impostor will be added as a separate file instead of replacing its predecessor.

### Quick Start Guide
